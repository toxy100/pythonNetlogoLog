pythonNetLogoLog repo contains python scripts that parse Netlogo Log files. The xml files will be parsed and turned into csv file with only essential information, including usernames, time stamps, button clicks, slider drags, and custom messages. 

NetLogoLogToBriefCsv.ipynb is the current version, with enhanced functions (choice of raw or brief report), clearer logic, added modularity, and more compact code.

PythonScript_1.8 has lines to collect stats of runs, such as counting button clicks and recording the length of model runs.
